# keyboard-layouts

The purpose of this repo is to store and version layouts and keymap files for programable keyboards.

## Flashing the RS96

Instructions to flash the Red Scarf III using the HID EEPROM firmware can be found [here](https://kairyu.gitbooks.io/red-scarf-ii-plus-user-guide-how-to-custom-layout/content/online_reflash.html).  It may be necessary to first install the [TKG Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tkg-chrome-app/kmbmjdabhpdnpeobnbdchihdcdaccidi).

After pasting the layout into TKG in step 2 of the instructions above, function keys should be mapped to match the config in the image below.  Optionally fn 25 can be set to `Backlight Action > Toggle`
